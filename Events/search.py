# Challenge	Goal:
    - To demonstrate the boatâ€™s ability to autonomously locate an object
    
    # Description:
        - An orange buoy will be placed somewhere within 100 m of a reference position
        - The boat must locate, touch, and signal* such within 10 minutes of entering the search area
        - RC is not allowed after entering the search area
        - 'Signal' means white strobe on boat and/or signal to a shore station and either turn into wind or assume station-keeping mode
    
    # Scoring:
        - 15 pts max
        - 12 pts for touching (w/o signal)
        - 9 pts for passing within 1m
        - 6 pts for performing a search pattern (creeping line, expanding square, direct tracking to buoy, etc)
    
    # Assumptions: (based on guidelines)
        - 
        
    # Strategy:
        - Define search path as series of GPS lines to cover the most ground in shortest time
        - If x% match verify:
            - Check if estimated position is outside of given bounds + buffer
        - Then deviate from course and go to position
            - If target confidence increases -> target lock & goto
            - if target confidence decreases ->
